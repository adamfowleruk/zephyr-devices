# Wearable base demo program

This demo shows all of the sensors working at the same time for
the base Herald nRF52833 wearable. It does not have any Herald-specific
code in it, but allows testing of the electrical connections with
Zephyr alone.

Each individual sensor has its own demo folder in this repository.
If you hit issues with this sample, try those out in sequence.
